# manager-readme

## Motivation for this document

I'm a developer at heart who likes writing documentation. I also like to read the manual to learn how things work (before I take them apart). Humans, specifically managers are complex systems which you can't (legally) take apart so this is my light-hearted attempt to make interactions with me easier.
## My role

Caveat: I'm new here so I'm still figuring this out. 

My two objectives are to recruit and retain a talented engineering team. One which can rapidly create customer value, ship and operate a high quality product.  The primary ways I do this are by sharing information that provides context and giving candid feedback.
## What do I value most?

I value autonomy and work to foster an environment that supports it. Wherever possible I will seek to challenge, question and push you; not instruct or do it for you. If you directly ask for my opinion or advice, of course I'll be forthcoming.

I try to be vulnerable, as I've discovered that it's a superpower in service of overcoming fear and building connection. This means I talk about things like failure, mental health, and being uncomfortable.

I value constructive feedback, even if it's raw. If you think I could improve, please tell me! I will give you performance feedback in a continuous manner.

I appreciate detail and work by diving deep, then drawing back for perspective. I've been told that curiosity is my superpower I tend to ask lots of questions and seek to understand how things work one layer deeper than what might feel necessary. 

## Communicating with me

I schedule reading email, generally in the morning and the afternoon. If you want me urgently, a DM on slack is better.

I prefer slack DMs if you need to connect with me.  LPlesee reach out. 

I use my calendar to organize my life. My calendar is publicly visible so that it's clear what I'm spending time on. If you need to talk to me urgently, I will make time for you if you DM me.
### 1:1s

I like to have weekly 1:1's with my direct team members where you set the agenda. These are super important to me. They aren't status reports unless you want to talk about status. They are a time for us to discuss ideas, share information and context, talk about your career, give feedback, and anything else that will help you to grow, learn and be successful. I valaue regular connection with others too but find I need to manage my time carefully. If you think a regular 1:1 with me would be beneficial, please reach out on slack. 

## Some personal things

My family are a big part of my life. I am the father of Joshua and Harrison (twins), born Jan 2019 and Lucy born April 2020.

I love running, I aspire to run a marathon before 2035.

I'm an amateur cyclist, I have a road bike that doesn't get much use currently. I mountain bike with the fam a lot.
